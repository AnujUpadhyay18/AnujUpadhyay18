Resume (short)
A motivated MERN developer with hands-on experience building e‑commerce platforms, analytics dashboards, admin panels, and realtime systems. I convert product requirements into production-ready software and focus on DX, maintainability and performance.

Featured projects
(These are pulled from the resume summary — replace with real repo links once you push them.)

- MERN E‑commerce Store — Full e‑commerce app with product/catalog management and payment integration.  
  Repo: `AnujUpadhyay18/mern-ecommerce` (placeholder) • Tech: React, Node, MongoDB, Stripe • Live: (add later)
- Realtime Analytics Dashboard — Dashboard with realtime updates, charts and export.  
  Repo: `AnujUpadhyay18/realtime-dashboard` (placeholder) • Tech: React, Node, Socket.IO, MongoDB
- Admin & CMS Panel — Admin panel with RBAC, CRUD and analytics.  
  Repo: `AnujUpadhyay18/admin-cms` (placeholder) • Tech: Next.js, Express, MongoDB

How to add your real projects
1. Push each project repository to GitHub (example names above are placeholders).  
2. Replace the placeholder repo links above with the real owner/repo links and add live demo URLs/screenshots.  
3. Pin 4–6 repos on your GitHub profile so visitors see them immediately.

Dynamic cards
- GitHub stats:

Notes & next steps
- I extracted a resume summary from the PDF you provided and used sensible defaults/placeholders where project URLs or contact URLs were missing.
- Please upload the actual project repositories and your resume PDF (name it AnujUpadhyay.pdf) to your profile repo (see next section) and then update the placeholders above.
- If you want, I can:
  - Replace placeholders with real project one-liners and links when you give repo names, or
  - Produce project README templates with deployment scripts and CI hints for each project.

How to use
1. Create a repository named exactly: `AnujUpadhyay18` (this is your profile repo).  
2. Put this file as `README.md` in the repository root. GitHub will render it on your profile.  
3. Add `resume.md` (I generated one for you) and the PDF `AnujUpadhyay.pdf` if you'd like a downloadable copy.  
4. Update the LinkedIn/portfolio/email links and replace project placeholders when your repos are pushed.

If you want me to now:
- Fill featured projects with actual repo names you upload (I can update the README when you give me the repo list), or
- Create individual README templates for each placeholder project (with setup, deploy, and features),
say which and I’ll generate them next.
